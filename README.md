Analysis of Ecommerce data:

This project focuses on finding the insights from the real world ecommerce data. The following questions are being answered:

1.)What percentage of shipments/orders were delivered late/early (by how many days) and if the shipping estimate was provided by Fenix? Note that when a customer choose fenix provides estimates, you'll see an estimated delivery date in the shipping option.

2).What percentage of shipments/orders were shipped late/early (by how many days) and if the shipping estimate was provided by Fenix? Note that when a customer choose fenix provides estimates, you'll see an estimated delivery date in the shipping option.

3).What the % orders were split between fenix and non-fenix shipping options?

4).What was the % of free vs. paid shipping (when customer paid for shipping) for fenix vs. non-fenix shipping options and also total amount of shipping amount (across all orders) was paid for fenix vs. non-fenix options orders?

The analysis is conducted in Python using Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib libraries. This is a simple project which helped me improve my basic concepts of analysis and is the first individual project done by me.

Please view the Jupyter Notebook attached in the repository for full project.
